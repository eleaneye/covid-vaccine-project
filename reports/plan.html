            <h3>Idea</h3>
            <p>For my final project, I would like to make a web app that will crowd source and compile Covid-19 vaccine
                availability in NC and update data from the <a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/">North Carolina Department
                    of Health and Human Service (NCDHHS)'s</a> database of vaccine locations (on the <a
                    href="https://myspot.nc.gov/">NCDHHS MySpot.NC.gov</a> website). Though the NC.gov site provides
                functionality to
                search for where to get the vaccine but it does not show any data about vaccine availability at each
                location. Pharmacies and other clinics may update their availability frequently and as the demand for
                vaccines is so high right now, it is crucial to have up to date information. In hearing about some
                friends/family's difficulty in finding accurate and up to date vaccine
                availability back home in a different state, I hope that this website that aggregates vaccines
                appointments across the state and
                provides that info to users can help people save time and reduce barriers to getting vaccinated!
            </p>

        <div>
            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <p>My goal is for the site to display up to date information about vaccine availability in NC. This will
                require features such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Locations and the number of available appointments</li>
                <li>A map and ability to search, filter (by distance, city, county, etc.)</li>
                <li>Interacivity in a map that can zoom in/out, search features, and expanding on location to see more
                    details (such as a link to book).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I will consider using the Vue framework and some basic componnts. I will also need some sort of map API
                and will look into Google Maps or the Leaflet API.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Data Sources</h3>
            <p>Data may be hard to obtain as currently there are no open source/available
                complete datasets of vaccine distributors or availability (at least none that I know of). Currently, I
                am thinking of web scraping or at least compiling a list of providers from the <a
                    href="https://myspot.nc.gov/">Myspot.nc.gov</a> site into a JSON file and then going into each
                individual provider site to further scrape and update data.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Data Structures</h3>
            <p>More unsure about this part. Plan to consult during office hours...(and would love to know how feasible
                this
                project is). Initial thoughts are 1) A JSON file with some providers, their information and
                location, and a ID. Then individual data objects for each with the vaccine info.</p>
