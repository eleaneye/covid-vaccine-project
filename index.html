            <h4>Project Idea</h4>
            <p>This final project attempts to make vaccine adverse reaction data more accessible to the public, by
                getting data from the CDC WONDER VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) database. It also
                attempts to
                contextualize and make more sense of all the data returned by giving summary statistics and allowing for
                filtering of results. Finally, allowing for easy user submission of data could help provide others with
                more information and insights about what others have experienced.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Data is first fetched from the CDC WONDER API, by sending a customized XML request. An XML response is
                returned and cleaned into a useable JSON format. This data is uploaded to firebase, as data is only
                refreshed weekly and there is no need to fetch constantly. This CDC data is made available on the
                front-end upon loading and filtering is processed on the front-end. Users are also able to login using
                Google OAuth and then submit their own adverse events/symptoms which are stored remotely in a Google
                Firebase real-time database. This user event data is also displayed in a tab called 'Crowdsourced Data'.
                The 'My Profile' tab allows users to see their submissions, and if admin, delete submissions and view
                all users who have accessed the app.
            </p>
